NOTES:
1) if warning appears about function overlapping, 
   it can show more functions changed that actually are.  
   In this case, look manually on all functions which were reported changed.  
2) If warning about search space which is too large appears, rerun adiff tool 
   with parameter "-vs=<k>" where <k> should be selected bigger than default value.  
   If the reported search space is too large to be handled in reasonable time, 
   results can be incorrect, study those files manually.
