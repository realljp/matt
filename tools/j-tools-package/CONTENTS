TOOLS

To compile and run do the following:

1. Use "setenv" command to set "experiment_root" variable which needs to point 
   where "subjects" directory lies (subjects directory contains subdirectories 
   which hold subject programs)

2. Type "make build-all" to build all the tools (gen_fault_matrix, misc_lib,
   adiff) in this directory.
    
3. To use fault-matix tools, see CONTENTS and README in gen_fault_matrix 
   directory. 


The j-tools-package directory contains the following files and subdirectories:

Makefile		Makefiles
Makefile.inc

adiff			functional diff tool

misc_lib		library

gen_fault_matrix	generation of fault matrices

lib			compiled libraries from adiff, misc_lib, and 
			gen_fault_matrix
