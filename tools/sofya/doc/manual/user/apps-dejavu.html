<h2 style="text-align:center">Using the DejaVu Regression Test Selector</h2>

<p>The first step in using DejaVu is to create a test history file for the version of the
program against which test selection will be performed. This is accomplished by performing
the following steps:
<ol>
<li>Use the <a href="cfg.html">CFG builder</a> to create control flow graphs for every class
of interest using a unique database dag (the resulting files will be placed in the database
directory and will be available to other &#931&#959&#966&#943&#945 tools).</li>
<li><a href="ed-structural.html">Instrument</a> the classes for basic block event dispatch,
and collect trace files by executing the program using the basic block tracer
(<code>BBTracer</code>).</li>
<li>Use the <a href="tools.html#thbuild">test history builder</a> to construct the test
history file.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>Next you need to create control flow graphs for the new version of the program for
which you want to select tests. Run the control flow graph on the same set of classes
in the new version, but using a different database tag. You are now ready to invoke
DejaVu as follows:</p>

<p><code>java sofya.apps.DejaVu &lt;old_prog_file&gt; &lt;new_prog_file&gt;
 &lt;test_history_file&gt; &lt;-t <i>s|l|t</i>&gt; &lt;tag1 <i>old_tag</i>&gt;
 &lt;tag2 <i>new_tag</i>&gt;</code></p>

<p>DejaVu will then display the selected tests for the new version, in the format specified
using the <code>-t</code> parameter. Specifying '<code>s</code>' will cause DejaVu to display
statistical information about the selected tests. A value of '<code>l</code>' will result
in a plain list of selected tests, suitable for supplying as input to another tool. The
final value '<code>t</code>' is the most useful for viewing as it will display a tabular
view correlating each method to the tests selected due to changes in that method. A data
file is also produced in the database directory, using the tag for the new version of the
program, that contains the test selection results. The
<a href="viewers.html#tsview">TestSelectionViewer</a> can be used to view the selected tests
at a later time without having to rerun DejaVu.</p>

<p>The '<code>prog</code>' parameters are specified in the same manner as with the
test history builder. Their corresponding <code>prog.lst</code> files should be in the
respective tag subdirectories in the &#931&#959&#966&#943&#945 database.</p>
