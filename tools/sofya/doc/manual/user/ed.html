<h2 style="text-align:center">&#931;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945; event dispatch framework overview</h2>

<p>The event dispatch components are the core of &#931;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945;;
these are the tools that actually provide for the processing and capture of
events observed in running Java programs. &#931;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945; provides
various classes that use the event dispatch framework to record trace files of
the events observed during program runs. These classes can serve both as a basis
for a variety of interesting trace-based analyses and as basic examples of how to
use the framework programmatically. The user manual will focus on how to use the
classes for trace file collection that are provided by
&#931;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945;.</p>
<!-- Extend this paragraph to reference implementation docs once they get
updated. -->

<p>&#931;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945;'s event dispatch framework is logically composed of
two major sub-packages to dispatch different types of event streams. The first type
of event stream is a semantic event stream. Informally, &#931;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945;
semantic events are considered to be those events that communicate information
that is sensitive to the meaning of the program as it impacts data state or control
dependence. Examples of such events are field reads and writes, and lock operations.
The second type of event stream is a structural event stream. This is an event
stream that communicates information about the execution of program code entities,
such as basic blocks and branch decisions. A familiar application of such event
streams is to measure program coverage. We provide a detailed discussion of the usage
of &#931;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945; provided instrumentation and trace collection classes
for each of these types of event streams.</p>
