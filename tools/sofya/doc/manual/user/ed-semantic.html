<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>An important concept used by the semantic event dispatch framework is the notion that
it is useful to identify some subset of the larger system for observation and analysis.
Such a subset of the system is referred to as a <em>module</em> for convenience, even
though the subset may comprise more than one logical module of the system under analysis.
The framework then uses instrumentation and the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/jpda/jdi/index.html">
Java Debug Interface</a> (JDI) to generate a stream of events occurring in the
module as the program executes, and dispatches that stream of events to registered
listeners. Event dispatch for concurrent Java programs is fully supported.</p>

<p>The quickest path to using this framework is to write an event description language
(EDL) specification for the Java program of interest. An EDL specification describes
the module for which to generate an event stream, and is defined as a set of classes
and observables associated with those classes for which events should
be dispatched. The full set of observables currently supported is described in
the <a href="#observables">observables</a> section.</p>

<p>The framework is also designed to be utilized as a programmable interface.
Event specifications can be supplied to the event dispatcher by creating a class
that implements the event specification interface. There are components
provided to facilitate implementation of custom filters that can be attached
to the event stream to select events of interest for particular analyses. Clients
of the framework therefore have great flexibility in defining what events they
want to observe, and in selecting relevant events from the stream to perform
their analyses.</p>


<h3><a name="edl"></a>Writing an Event Description Language (EDL) Specification</h3>

<p>An event description language specification is comprised of a set of sections that
define the observables for which events are to be generated in the event stream, and
that provide facilities for specifying conditions on the locations in which
the events related to those observables should be witnessed. The following is
the informal, basic structure of an EDL specification:</p>
<pre>
  begin <b>EDLSuite</b> <i>&lt;name&gt;</i>
    ( global_array_element_bounds )*
  end
  ( (begin <b>Observables</b> <i>&lt;key&gt;</i>
      begin <b>Preamble</b>
          System-classes: <i>&lt;prog_file&gt;</i>
          <i>(Preamble declarations...)</i>
      end
      (
        (+ | -) <i>observable_event_request</i> [ {
            (<i>locationCondition</i>)*
            } ]
      )*
    )
  | (@import &quot;<i>&lt;edl_file&gt;</i>&quot;)
  )+

<i>Preamble declarations</i>:
  ( Module-classes: &lt;<i>prog_file</i>&gt;
    | No-module: ("true" | "false") )
  [ Database-tag: &lt;<i>tag</i>&gt; ]
  [ Type-name: &lt;<i>type_name</i>&gt; (&lt;<i>jni_signature</i>&gt; | &lt;<i>class_name</i>&gt;) ]

</pre>
<p>
where
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>name</i> is a name to be associated with the EDL specification. It is used
to track and store generated framework data associated with the specification.</li>
<li><i>key</i> is a name to be associated with an <b>Observables</b> section. These
uniquely distinguish independent observable event specifications.</li>
<li><i>prog_file</i> is a reference to a &quot;program list file&quot; in the
database directory. In addition to the name, it should include (just) the
extension &quot;.prog&quot;.</li>
<li><i>observable_event_request</i> is a record specifying the inclusion or
exclusion of a type of observable event, as described in the EDL grammar
(linked below) and later in this document.</li>
<li><i>edl_file</i> is the name of another EDL file to be textually imported at
the given location.</li>
<li><i>class_name</i> is a fully qualified class name using dot notation.</li>
<li><i>jni_signature</i> is a type signature using the Java Native Interface (JNI)
style notation (refer to the Java Language Specification).</li>
</ul>

<p>For a full formal specification, it is recommended that you refer to the
<a href="edl_bnf_table.html">BNF grammar for EDL</a>. It may also be helpful to look at the
<a href="edl_bnf_detail.html">detailed grammar breakdown</a>, with documentation and additional
details on particular productions in the EDL grammar.
</p>
<p>The remainder of this document is intended as a quickstart guide for writing
EDL specifications.

<h4>EDLSuite Section</h4>

<p>The <b>EDLSuite</b> section defines a name to be associated with the rest of
the EDL specification. This name is used by the framework to store the
information derived from the remainder of the specification to make it
available to the semantic event dispatcher. The name should be unique; if there
is a name collision you will be notified when you run the semantic
instrumentor (this is not, however, considered a warning, as it may occur
if you run the instrumentor more than once on the same EDL specification).
</p>

<p>Global array element bounds can also be declared in the <b>EDLSuite</b>
section. This is accomplished with one or more
&quot;<code>array_element_load_bounds</code>&quot; or
&quot;<code>array_element_store_bounds</code>&quot; declarations. The format
of these declarations is the same as for the
&quot;<code>array_element_load</code>&quot; and
&quot;<code>array_element_store</code>&quot; event requests (see below), except
that at least one of the minimum or maximum bounds must be given. A global
element index bound applies when the element type and event type matches
with a array element event request in an <b>Observables</b> section, and
that event request does not specify the corresponding bound. Element index bounds
specified in particular event requests override global bounds. Note that the
act of declaring global array element bounds does not in itself enable observation
of array element events &mdash; a corresponding array element event request must be made.
</p>

<h4>Observables Section</h4>

<p>An <b>Observables</b> section defines the set of observable events that
are to be supplied by the semantic event dispatcher. The <i>key</i>
associated with an Observables section is used to uniquely distinguish
independent sets of event requests (from here referred to as an
&quot;event specification&quot;) so that they may operate simultaneously
to receive required events from the same run of a semantic event dispatcher.
This is most important when using the adaptive event request features
of the event dispatcher, in that it enables the event dispatcher to mediate
conflicting event enable/disable requests such that listeners requiring
certain events are always guaranteed to receive those events.</p>

<p>A particular <b>Observables</b> section must always begin with a
<b>Preamble</b> section. The Preamble defines basic information about that
particular set of observable event requests. The basic piece of information
that is required in all Preamble sections is a reference to the
&quot;program list file&quot; that defines all the classes comprising the
entire system to be monitored. This is the maximal set of classes over which
the semantic instrumentor will operate to perform the necessary actions
to capture requested events. The Preamble also supports several optional
statements:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Module-classes: <i>&lt;prog_file&gt;</i></b> This option specifies a
program list file in the database that lists classes for which <b>all</b>
observable events are to be enabled by default. A subtractive approach
can then be used to selectively disable events within this set of classes
(see discussion of observable event requests below). This enables easier
specification of entire subsystems or modules within the monitored system
for observation. Note that if this option is not provided, and the
&quot;<b>No-module</b>&quot; (see following) option is absent or is
<code>false</code>, the set of system classes is treated as the module
by default (all events in all classes will be observed).</li>
<li><b>No-module: <i>&lt;true|false&gt;</i></b> This option specifies that
there are no classes comprising a default module; All events must be
requested explicitly. <strong>Note that <i>class</i> wildcards ('*' where a
class name is required) are relative to the module, and thus will not select
any classes</strong> if this option is enabled (or the module defined using
<b>Module-classes</b> contains no classes).</li>
<li><b>Database-tag: <i>&lt;tag&gt;</i></b> This option specifies a database
tag to be used to locate the program list files referenced by the
<b>System-classes</b> and <b>Module-classes</b> values.</li>
<li><b>Type-name: <i>&lt;name&gt;</i> <i>&lt;type_def&gt;</i></b><br> This
option provides for the definition of substitute names for method
argument types, as a convenience. Wherever <i>name</i> appears as an
argument type, it will be replaced by <i>type_def</i>. This allows more
concise statement of signatures for methods involving long types that
are otherwise cumbersome. Note that these definitions have highest precedence
during processing of argument types, thus a matching substitution will always
be applied even if it overrides a predefined value.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Observable Event Requests</h4>

<p>An observable event request begins with either a '+' or '-'
which indicates whether the request will define a rule for including or excluding
events related to the observable. Next is the name of the observable to which the
rule applies. The syntax of the remainder of the line is then variable depending
on the type of the observable the rule addresses, as described in the
<a href="#observables">list of observables</a> below.</p>

<p>For many observables, it is possible to specify conditions that constrain
the locations at which the events relevant to the observable will be witnessed.
These conditions are specified within braces using the keywords 'in' or
'not'. An 'in' condition specifies that an observable event
should only be raised if the event occurred in a given location. A 'not'
condition specifies that an observable event should only be raised if the event
did not occur in a given location. Requests that permit location conditions
require the use of the brace notation, however, specifying no conditions is
permitted and is treated as the equivalent of 'any location'.</p>

<p>Many observables can be specified using wildcards. For example, all fields in
a class can be included with a notation such as this: 'SomeClass.*'.
However this leads to the possibility that the rules specifying inclusion and
exclusion of observables can conflict. Therefore requests also have a precedence,
which is assigned in increasing order as the <b>Observables</b> section is read from
top to bottom. Requests with higher precedence always overrule requests of lower
precedence, which allows greater flexibility in defining the observables to
be included. For example, a rule of lower precedence might specify that a broad
set of observables are to be included, but a rule of higher precedence will
selectively exclude certain observables within that set. For any observable,
the rule matching the observable with the highest precedence will always be
applied.</p>

<p>Precedence also affects the location conditions; in fact, the precedence is
actually associated with each condition (though an implied precedence is assigned for
requests that have no conditions). A request with higher precedence but with
a location condition that does <strong>not</strong> conflict with the location
condition on a request with lower precedence will not override the rule from the
request with lower precedence. If there is a hierarchical relationship between
two locations, the location conditions will nest within each other, thus
an 'in' rule followed by a 'not' rule can be read as:
&quot;the event should be generated if it happens in location X but only if
not in location Y within X&quot;. For location conditions that conflict with
each other without a nesting relationship, the conditions with highest
precedence are applied as usual.</p>

<p>Location conditions within different observable event requests (for the same
type of observable) will also be nested if appropriate. The requests themselves,
however, are <strong>never</strong> nested, they can only override some subset
(or superset) of a prior record. This is an important consideration to be careful
of when writing more complex specifications.</p>

<p>The scope of precedence is limited to each event specification
(<b>Observables</b> section). In other words, event requests in one event
specification do not have a precedence with respect to event requests in
another event specification. Each event specification is an independent
entity.</p>


<h4><a name="observables"></a>Supported Observable Events</h4>

<p>The following is a current list of types of events that can
be requested in an EDL specification. It is presented using a style similar
to EBNF notation, but in a manner that is intended to more clearly illustrate
the construction of the event requests, as compared to the formal grammar.
The syntax used is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>( ) : expression/choice grouping</li>
<li>[ ] : optional expression</li>
<li>| : choice between two or more expressions</li>
<li>* : zero or more occurrences</li>
<li>+ : one or more occurrences</li>
<li>"(text)" : literal string or keyword</li>
<li><i>text</i> : string identified by symbolic name; the valid structure can
be determined from the formal grammar, most often a string that is legal as
a Java identifier or a qualified Java identifer</li>
<li>&lt;<i>:text:</i>&gt; : string identified by a symbolic name that is
eligible for matching and substitution from the type alias table (type aliases
specified using &quot;Type-name&quot; declarations in the &quot;Preamble&quot;)</li>
<li><i>jniMethodSignature</i> : JNI-style method signature string (see
the Java Virtual Machine Specification for details); essentially:

greater than the maximum bound, writes to the &quot;tails&quot; of the array are
observed (from the start to the maximum, and from the minimum to the end).</p>

<p class="i1">Multiple <code>array_element_store</code> event selections for the same element type may
result in merging of the element ranges specified using index bounds.</p>


<h4>Importing Other EDL Files</h4>

<p>The EDL specification supports a statement of the form:<p>
<pre>
  @import "other.edl"
</pre>
<p>These statements must appear outside of any section. When an import
statement is encountered, the parser textually inserts the contents of the
specified EDL file into the current file at that location. This enables
one to store event specifications that select events for particular purposes
(analyses) as fragments in a modular fashion, and then combine them to
create composite specifications to, for example, check multiple
independent properties simultaneously.</p>


<h3><a name="exdesc"></a>Example EDL Specification</h3>

<p>The following is a very simple EDL specification intended just to
illustrate the basic behaviors described above.</p>

<pre>
begin EDLSuite example_spec
end
begin Observables example_events
  begin Preamble
    System-classes: sys.prog
    Module-classes: mod.prog

    Type-name: Writer java.io.Writer
  end

  - virtual_call BlockSynchronization.* {
      in ProgramCore.*
      not ProgramCore.setup Writer
    }
  + virtual_call BlockSynchronization.init * {
    }
end
</pre>

<p>Classes listed in 'sys.prog' comprise the entire Java program of interest.
Classes in 'mod.prog' comprise the subset of the system classes that are
considered observable by default (all observable events within these classes are
considered included unless explicitly excluded).</p>

<p>The first rule specifies that all calls to virtual methods implemented in the
class <code>BlockSynchronization</code> are to be excluded if they occur in any method
in class <code>ProgramCore</code> except if they occur in method 'setup' of
class <code>ProgramCore</code> that takes a <code>Writer</code> as an argument.
Note that package qualifiers would be permitted (required, in fact) for
<code>BlockSynchronization</code> and <code>ProgramCore</code> if appropriate.</p>

<p>The second rule specifies that all calls to the virtual method 'init' of
class <code>BlockSynchronization</code> with any signature are to be included
regardless of where they occur. This overrides the first record for calls to
method(s) 'init', but not for calls to any other method.</p>


<h3><a name="dispatch"></a>Running the Event Dispatcher</h3>

<p>To use the semantic event instrumentor from the command line, first create an
EDL specification as described above. Then run the instrumentor using the following command:</p>

<p><code>java sofya.ed.semantic.SemanticInstrumentor [-dabe] &lt;edl_spec&gt;</code></p>

<p>Normally, the instrumentor inserts instrumentation to observe when the program
execution leaves and enters the module identified in the specification. This is intended to allow
the consumer of an event stream to properly maintain the current context of the execution.
The optional parameter '<code>-dabe</code>' (disable automatic boundary events) is
provided to instruct the instrumentor to not instrument for these events.</p>


<h3><a name="dispatch-trace"></a>Running the Semantic Tracer</h3>

<p>To execute a program instrumented for semantic event dispatch on the command line,
run the following command:<p>

<p><code>java sofya.ed.SemanticTracer [-cout] &lt;-md <i>data_file</i>&gt;
&lt;-main <i>main_class</i>&gt; [<i>arg_1</i> <i>arg_2</i> ...]</code></p>
<p class="i1"><code>-cout</code>
<p class="i2">Instructs the tracer to echo the events to the
console on <code>stdout</code>.</p>
<p class="i1"><code>-md <i>data_file</i></code>
<p class="i2">Specifies the name of the module data file generated
by the semantic event instrumentor.</p>
<p class="i1"><code>-main <i>main_class</i></code>
<p class="i2">Specifies the fully qualified name of the main class
that is used to launch the program. The subsequent optional argument parameters
are the arguments that should be passed to the traced program.</p>

<p>The semantic tracer generates a binary trace file in the current directory
containing the events raised during the execution of the program. There is
currently no convenience viewer provided for this type of trace file, nor
is there a class for reading the trace file programmatically. The format
of this file can be derived from the <code>TraceFileTarget</code> class,
however, these trace files are intended primarily as a demonstration of the
use of the framework. Clients of the framework should write their own
listeners to generate trace files in whatever format desired, or to process
the event stream directly online.</p>


<h3><a name="implnotes"></a>Notes on Implementation and Concurrency Issues</h3>

<p>Monitoring multi-threaded systems in Java poses special challenges for instrumentation.
It was determined through the course of implementation that it would not be possible
to monitor all types of observables solely through the use of instrumentation. The
principle problem is that it must be possible to guarantee the atomic integrity of
information transmitted from the probes inserted in the instrumentation process.
Unfortunately the only means to guarantee the atomicity of such information for some
types of observables is synchronization of probes on a system-global common lock,
which excessively interferes with the natural behavior of the system. This
degree of interference would also invalidate the information obtained. Therefore this
implementation uses the Java Debug Interface in conjunction with instrumentation to
meet the need for monitoring specified observables in a non-disruptive manner.</p>

<p>In order to collect information about some types of specified observables, the
implementation applies instrumentation at the bytecode level, by operating on the
class files comprising the system. The instrumentor may potentially insert
instrumentation into any class in the system, as this is often necessary to monitor
all actions related to certain types of observables. Instrumentation is also
used in some cases to improve the efficiency of the runtime monitoring over that
yielded by the JDI.</p>

<p>Probes are currently inserted to observe allocation of new objects, invocation of
constructors and methods, and entry into methods. Method calls and entries
are observed using instrumentation probes due to the nature of the JDI. Requesting
observation of method entries and exits through the JDI is all or nothing.
Constraining observation of such events in the manner desired for this application,
for example observing only methods matching a certain signature,
would require a filtering process in the tracing tool. Many unnecessary events would
be raised by the JDI, in addition to the extra cost of applying this dynamic filtering
in the tracing tool. By instead inserting probes in the bytecodes to specifically
observe events relevant only to specified methods, a considerable reduction in
overhead is achieved.</p>

<p>The result of the instrumentation process is set of class files containing the
probes necessary to monitor a subset of the observables defined in the EDL
specification, and a module data file to be supplied to the event dispatcher which
contains information necessary for that tool to provide complete coverage
of the specified observables. Among other things, this data file contains a compiled
version of the EDL specification.</p>

<p><em>Note that the instrumentation should only ever be applied once, or the
behavior is undefined.</em> If the parameters of the instrumentation need to
be changed, the system should be recompiled first and then instrumented again.</p>
