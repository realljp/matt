<h2 style="text-align:center">Using the structural event dispatch framework</h2>

<a name="cfInst"></a>
<h3>Running the Instrumentor</h3>

<h4>Getting Started</h4>

<p>To run the instrumentor to instrument a class for structural event dispatch,
use the following command:</p>

<p><code>java sofya.ed.cfInstrumentor [-tag <i>tag</i>] &lt;-&lt;E|X|C|B&gt;|-branch&gt;
&lt;classname|jarfile|listfile&gt; [classname|jarfile ...] </code></p>

<p>The <code>tag</code> parameter can be used to specify a database tag associated
with the control flow and map files required by the instrumentor
(see information on the <a href="graphs.html#cfg">CFG builder</a>). If you did
not specify a tag to the CFG builder when constructing the control flow graphs
for the classes you intend to instrument, you do not need to use this
parameter.</p>

<p>The first required parameter specifies either basic block instrumentation or branch
instrumentation. To instrument basic blocks, any combination of the characters E, X, C, and B
can be specified, where E specifies virtual <em>entry</em> blocks, X specifies virtual
<em>exit</em> blocks, C specifies call blocks, and B specifies all other basic blocks. Entry
and exit blocks do not correspond to actual code, but rather provide information about entry
to and exit from methods. Branch instrumentation is not parameterized, though branch
types can be filtered at runtime (this is discussed under
<a href="#dispatch">running the event dispatcher</a>).

<p>When specifying a single class for instrumentation, the rules regarding inclusion of the
<em>.class</em> extension are the same as for the <a href="graphs.html#cfg">CFG builder</a>.
However, the instrumentor exhibits  additional behaviors with respect to
the format of the class name. If an absolute path is given, the instrumentation
will be directly applied to the given classfile, at the classfile's current location.
If the class is loaded from the classpath, the resulting instrumented classfile will
be placed in the working directory from which the instrumentor is run.</p>

<p>The instrumentor also accepts jar files and program list files to specify the classes
to be instrumented. Program list files are automatically found in the database, using
the tag if one is specified. Any necessary path information
should be provided when passing a jar file as an argument. When a jar file is passed
as an argument on the command line, every class in the jar is instrumented.
The preferred way to include classes in a jar file is to include the jar file
in a program list file and supply the program list file as an argument instead, as a
program list file permits you to exclude classes in the jar from processing. Any number
of specific classes, jar files, and program list files can be passed to the instrumentor,
though supplying a single program list file is the expected typical use.</p>

<h4>Advanced Instrumentation</h4>

<p>Running the instrumentor as described in <em>Getting Started</em> instruments
class files for observation of basic block coverage events. The full
usage for the instrumentor is the following:</p>

<p><code>java sofya.ed.cfInstrumentor [-tag <i>tag</i>] &lt;-&lt;B|E|X|C&gt;|-branch&gt; [-t
&lt;norm|junit|seq&gt;[,junit]] [-port <i>port</i>] [-so] &lt;classname|jarfile|listfile&gt;
[classname|jarfile ...]</code></p>

<p>The <code>-t</code> parameter is used to change the inserted instrumentation
to target different mechanisms for observing events. Currently,
the following values for this parameter are available:
<ul>
<li><code>norm</code>: The default, this instrumentation supports dispatch of
coverage event streams. Sequence event streams cannot be dispatched using
this instrumentation.
<li><code>seq</code>: This instrumentation enables dispatch of sequence event
streams. Coverage event streams can also be collected, but less efficiently.
<li><code>junit</code>: This instrumentation enables dispatch of event streams through
the <code>JUnit</code> framework during execution of a <code>JUnit</code> test
suite. Event streams can be dispatched from classes containing this instrumentation
only by using the <code>junit.textui.SelectiveTestRunner</code>; regular
event dispatchers will not operate on this instrumentation. This value is actually
a modifier that can be combined with <code>norm</code> or <code>seq</code> to
allow dispatch of either of those respective types of event streams from the
execution of a <code>JUnit</code> test suite. When used alone, <code>junit</code>
is equivalent to <code>norm,junit</code>, enabling dispatch of coverage event
streams from JUnit tests.
</ul>
</p>

<p>If the event dispatcher reports an error about being unable to bind to a socket,
the <code>-port</code> parameter can be used to change the socket used by the
instrumentation. If you specify a custom port during instrumentation, you must
specify the same port to the event dispatcher when you run the instrumented class.</p>

<p>The <code>-so</code> parameter is used to instruct the instrumentor to only insert
into a class the instrumentation necessary to establish the connection between a
subject and the event dispatcher. If you want to instrument certain classes, but
not the class that is the entry point for the application, you will want
to use this option on the class that is the entry point (the class containing the
<code>main</code> method). This is most often useful for test driver classes that
execute instrumented classes, but that are themselves not of interest for
instrumentation or event dispatch.</p>

<a name="dispatch"></a>
<h3>Running the Event Dispatcher</h3>

<p>The principle class for dispatching structural event streams is the
<code>ProgramEventDispatcher</code>. This class is not directly executable,
however the &quot;tracer&quot; classes in the <code>ed</code> package of
&#931;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945; are classes that generate trace files using the
<code>ProgramEventDispatcher</code>. For structural tracing, these consist of
<code>BBTracer</code> (basic block coverage traces),
<code>BBSequenceTracer</code> (basic block sequence traces),
<code>BranchTracer</code> (branch coverage traces),
and <code>BranchSequenceTracer</code> (branch sequence traces). These classes
serve as example implementations using the structural event dispatcher,
and, with the assistance of the <code>TraceHandler</code>, can be used without
modification to create trace-based analyses.</p>

<h4>Getting Started</h4>

<p>To use <code>BBTracer</code> to collect a basic block coverage
trace of the execution of an instrumented program, make sure the main class
of the program can be found on your Java classpath. Then run the
following command:</p>

<p><code>java sofya.ed.BBTracer -&lt;E|X|C|B&gt; &lt;classname&gt;</code>
<code>&lt;arguments&gt;</code></p>

<p>The first parameter functions the same way as described for the instrumentor,
where any combination of the given values can be specified. Only blocks of the
selected types will be included in the generated trace file, where E specifies
virtual <em>entry</em> blocks, X specifies virtual <em>exit</em> blocks, C
specifies call blocks, and B specifies all other basic blocks. For performance
reasons, the typical usage is to trace all of the block types for which
instrumentation was inserted. However, this filtering capability provides the
opportunity to instrument a program for multiple types of blocks and then select
only the block types of interest to a particular analysis when collecting traces.
Note that if a block type is requested that was not specified during
instrumentation, information about those blocks will <em>not</em> appear
in the generated trace.</p>

<p>The <code>classname</code> argument should be the fully qualified name of
the main class for the program, and should <em>not</em> include the
<em>.class</em> extension.</p>

<p>By default, the tracer will create a file named &quot;instout.tr&quot; in the
database directory which contains the trace information. Each time the tracer
is run it will overwrite this file, unless otherwise specified (see below),
so it is the responsibility of the user to store the file somewhere permanent,
if desired. The trace file can be viewed using the
<a href="viewers.html#TraceViewer">TraceViewer</a>.</p>

<p>The basic usage for the other tracers is essentially the same. In the case of the
branch tracers, the branch types that can be selected are as follows:
<ul>
<li>I: Branches originating at &quot;<code>if</code>&quot; instructions.</li>
<li>S: Branches originating at &quot;<code>switch</code>&quot; instructions.</li>
<li>T: Branches representing control flow possibilities out of
&quot;<code>throws</code>&quot; instructions, if any.</li>
<li>C: Branches representing control flow possibilities out of call
instructions (caused by exceptional control flow), if any.</li>
<li>E: The &quot;entry&quot; branch into a method. Not really a branch, but
useful to some analyses.</li>
<li>O: Branches representing control flow possibilities caused by any
other exceptional control flow that cannot be statically determined
(e.g. exit from a method caused by undeclared and unhandled unchecked
exceptions).</li>
</ul>
As with the basic block tracers, these options can be combined in any way.</p>

<h4>Advanced Tracing</h4>

<p>There are additional options available for controlling the behavior of
the various tracers. The <code>BBTracer</code> and <code>BBSequenceTracer</code>
classes will be used to describe these options. The same options apply
to the <code>BranchTracer</code> and <code>BranchSequenceTracer</code>.</p>

<h5>BBTracer and BranchTracer</h5>

<p>The full usage for <code>BBTracer</code> is the following:</p>

<code>java sofya.ed.BBTracer [-port <i>n</i>] [-cp <i>path</i>]
 [-i] [-tl <i>num_secs</i>] [-at] [-o <i>output_file</i>] [-trname <i>trace_name</i>]
 -&lt;E|X|C|B&gt; &lt;classfileName&gt; &lt;arguments&gt;</code></p>

<p class="i1"><code>-port <i>n</i></code></p>
<p class="i2">Instructs the tracer to listen for the instrumentation
connection on port number <i>n</i>.</p>
<p class="i1"><code>-cp <i>path</i></code></p>
<p class="i2">Causes the tracer to set the CLASSPATH for the subject
program to <i>path</i>.</p>
<p class="i1"><code>-i</code></p>
<p class="i2">Enables piping of <code>stdin</code> to the subject
program. Programs requiring user input will deadlock if this option is not enabled.</p>
<p class="i1"><code>-tl <i>num_secs</i></code></p>
<p class="i2">Instructs the tracer to kill the subject after
<i>num_secs</i> if it has not yet terminated. This option should be used instead
of sending a kill signal to the tracer, as it enables the tracer to perform cleanup
and generate the trace file for the subject program up to the point it was terminated.</p>
<p class="i1"><code>-at</code></p>
<p class="i2">Causes the tracer to append the current trace to the
existing trace file of the same name, if it already exists.</p>
<p class="i1"><code>-trname <i>trace_name</i></code></p>
<p class="i2">Instructs the tracer to name the trace file
<i>trace_name</i>. The <em>.tr</em> extension should be omitted.</p>
<p class="i1"><code>-o <i>output_file</i></code></p>
<p class="i2">Causes the tracer to redirect the subject program's output
to <i>output_file</i>. Both <code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code> are redirected
to the specified file.</p>
<p class="i1"><code>-&lt;B|E|X|C&gt;</code></p>
<p class="i2">Specifies the block types to be included in the generated
trace. All permutations are allowed.</p>

<h5>BBSequenceTracer and BranchSequenceTracer</h5>

<p>The sequence tracers are used to collect traces recording the full sequence
of program entities executed during a program run, in the order observed. A program
must be instrumented for sequence tracing to use this tracer; a program instrumented
for coverage tracing will not work. This tracer produces a trace file in
the database directory named &quot;instout.seq&quot; that is readable without
the use of a viewer. These tracers provide the following additional options:</p>

<p class="i1"><code>-pre <i>data</i></code></p>
<p class="i2">Causes the tracer to insert <i>data</i> at the start
of the trace file, before any trace data.</p>
<p class="i1"><code>-post <i>data</i></code></p>
<p class="i2">Causes the tracer to append <i>data</i> at the end
of the trace file, after any trace data.</p>
<p class="i1"><code>-relay</code></p>
<p class="i2">Instructs the tracer to transmit the trace
(including any <code>-pre</code> or <code>-post</code> data) through a socket
to the port used by a DAG builder to perform dynamic impact analysis.</p>

Note that by default the <code>BBSequenceTracer</code> writes <em>entry</em>
and <em>exit</em> block events to the trace file in a format specifically
designed for use in a particular type of DAG construction for impact
analysis. New filters can be written to generate trace files in other
formats. Finally, be aware that the trace files generated by this tracer can
be extremely large.</p>
