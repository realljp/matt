<h3>Running the Instrumentor</h3>
<a name="cfInst"></a>

<h4>Getting Started</h4>

<p>To run the instrumentor to instrument a class for traced execution, use the following command:</p>

<p><code>java sofya.inst.cfInstrumentor [-tag <i>tag</i>] &lt;-&lt;E|X|C|B&gt;|-branch&gt;
&lt;classname|jarfile|listfile&gt; [classname|jarfile ...] </code></p>

<p>The <code>tag</code> parameter is used to specify a database tag associated
with the control flow and map files required by the instrumentor
(see information on the <a href="graphs.html#cfg">CFG builder</a>). If you did
not specify a tag to the CFG builder when constructing the control flow graphs
for the classes you intend to instrument, you do not need to use this
parameter.</p>

<p>The first required parameter specifies either basic block instrumentation or branch
instrumentation. To instrument basic blocks, any combination of the characters E, X, C, and B
can be specified, where E specifies virtual <em>entry</em> blocks, X specifies virtual
<em>exit</em> blocks, C specifies call blocks, and B specifies all other basic blocks. Entry
and exit blocks do not correspond to actual code, but rather provide information about entry
to and exit from methods. Branch instrumentation is not parameterized, though branch
types can be filtered during tracing (this is discussed under <a href="#tracers">tracing</a>).

<p>When specifying a single class for instrumentation, the rules regarding inclusion of the
<em>.class</em> extension are the same as for the <a href="graphs.html#cfg">CFG builder</a>.
However, the instrumentor exhibits  additional behaviors with respect to
the format of the class name. If an absolute path is given, the instrumentation
will be directly applied to the given classfile, at the classfile's current location.
If the class is loaded from the classpath, the resulting instrumented classfile will
be placed in the working directory from which the instrumentor is run.</p>

<p>The instrumentor also accepts jar files and program list files to specify the classes
to be instrumented. Program list files are automatically found in the database, using
the tag if one is specified. Any necessary path information
should be provided when passing a jar file as an argument. When a jar file is passed
as an argument on the command line, every class in the jar is instrumented.
The preferred way to include classes in a jar file is to include the jar file
in a program list file and supply the program list file as an argument instead, as a
program list file permits you to exclude classes in the jar from processing. Any number
of specific classes, jar files, and program list files can be passed to the instrumentor,
though supplying a single program list file is the expected typical use.</p>

<h4>Advanced Instrumentation</h4>

<p>Running the instrumentor as described in <em>Getting Started</em> instruments class
files for collection of coverage traces using the standard filter for tracing. The full
usage for the instrumentor is the following:</p>

<p><code>java sofya.inst.cfInstrumentor [-tag <i>tag</i>] &lt;-&lt;B|E|X|C&gt;|-branch&gt; [-t
&lt;norm|junit|seq&gt;[,junit]] [-port <i>port</i>] [-so] &lt;classname|jarfile|listfile&gt;
[classname|jarfile ...]</code></p>

<p>The <code>-t</code> parameter is used to change the inserted instrumentation
to target different mechanisms for collecting the trace information. Currently,
the following values for this parameter are available:
<ul>
<li><code>norm</code>: The default, this instrumentation enables generation
of coverage traces. Sequence traces cannot be generated from this instrumentation.
<li><code>seq</code>: This instrumentation enables generation of sequence traces.
Coverage traces can also be collected, but less efficiently.
<li><code>junit</code>: This instrumentation enables generation of traces through
the <code>JUnit</code> framework during execution of a <code>JUnit</code> test
suite. Traces can be generated from classes containing this instrumentation
only by using the <code>junit.textui.SelectiveTestRunner</code>; regular
filter tracers will fail. This value is actually a modifier that can be combined
with <code>norm</code> or </code>seq</code> to allow generation of either of those
respective types of traces from the execution of a <code>JUnit</code> test suite.
When used alone, <code>junit</code> is equivalent to <code>norm,junit</code>,
enabling generation of coverage traces of JUnit tests.
</ul>
</p>

<p>If a tracer reports an error about being unable to bind to a socket, the <code>-port</code>
parameter can be used to change the socket used by the instrumentation. If you specify a custom
port during instrumentation, you must specify the same port to the tracer when you run the
instrumented class.</p>

<p>The <code>-so</code> parameter is used to instruct the instrumentor to only insert
the code that starts the connection to a tracer. This is useful for test driver
classes which execute instrumented classes, but which are themselves not of interest for
instrumentation or tracing.</p>

<h3>Running the Tracers</h3>
<a name="tracers"></a>

<p>The program tracers in the <code>inst</code> package of &#931&#959&#966&#943&#945
are the classes with names containing <code>Filter</code>, which derives from the
fact that the tracers all support some type of filtering of the trace events raised
by the instrumentation. These are the tools used to execute instrumented programs
and collect trace files that record the behaviors of those programs.</p>

<h4>Getting Started</h4>

<p>To use the basic tracer (<code>Filter</code>) to collect a basic block coverage
trace of the execution of an instrumented program, make sure the main class can be
found on your Java classpath. Then run the following command:</p>

<p><code>java sofya.inst.Filter -&lt;E|X|C|B&gt; &lt;classname&gt;</code> 
<code>&lt;arguments&gt;</code></p>

<p>The first parameter functions the same way as described for the instrumentor,
where any combination of the given values can be specified. Only blocks of the
selected types will be included in the generated trace file, where E specifies
virtual <em>entry</em> blocks, X specifies virtual <em>exit</em> blocks, C
specifies call blocks, and B specifies all other basic blocks. For performance
reasons, the typical usage is to trace all of the block types for which
instrumentation was inserted. However, this filtering capability provides the
opportunity to instrument a program for all types of blocks and then select
only the block types of interest to particular analyses when collecting traces.
Note that if a block type is requested that was not specified during
instrumentation, information about those blocks will <em>not</em> appear
in the generated trace.</p>

<p>The <code>classname</code> argument should be the fully qualified name of
the main class for the program, and should <em>not</em> include the
<em>.class</em> extension.</p>

<p>By default, the tracer will create a file named &quot;instout.tr&quot; in the
database directory which contains the trace information. Each time the tracer
is run it will overwrite this file, unless otherwise specified (see below),
so it is the responsibility of the user to store the file somewhere permanent,
if desired. The trace file can be viewed using the
<a href="viewers.html#TraceViewer">TraceViewer</a>.</p>

<h4>Advanced Tracing</h4>

<p>There are additional options available for controlling the behavior of
<code>Filter</code>, as well as other tracers to collect different types of
traces.</p>

<h5>Filter</h5>

<p>The full usage for <code>Filter</code> is the following:</p>

<code>java sofya.inst.Filter [-port <i>n</i>] [-cp <i>path</i>]
 [-i] [-tl <i>num_secs</i>] [-at] [-o <i>output_file</i>] [-trname <i>trace_name</i>]
 -&lt;E|X|C|B&gt; &lt;classfileName&gt; &lt;arguments&gt;</code></p>

<p style="margin-left:2em"><code>-port <i>n</i></code></p>
<p style="margin-left:4em">Instructs the tracer to listen for the instrumentation
connection on port number <i>n</i>.</p>
<p style="margin-left:2em"><code>-cp <i>path</i></code></p>
<p style="margin-left:4em">Causes the tracer to set the CLASSPATH for the subject
program to <i>path</i>.</p>
<p style="margin-left:2em"><code>-i</code></p>
<p style="margin-left:4em">Enables piping of <code>stdin</code> to the subject
program. Programs requiring user input will deadlock if this option is not enabled.</p>
<p style="margin-left:2em"><code>-tl <i>num_secs</i></code></p>
<p style="margin-left:4em">Instructs the tracer to kill the subject after
<i>num_secs</i> if it has not yet terminated. This option should be used instead
of sending a kill signal to the tracer, as it enables the tracer to perform cleanup
and generate the trace file for the subject program up to the point it was terminated.</p>
<p style="margin-left:2em"><code>-at</code></p>
<p style="margin-left:4em">Causes the tracer to append the current trace to the
existing trace file of the same name, if it already exists.</p>
<p style="margin-left:2em"><code>-trname <i>trace_name</i></code></p>
<p style="margin-left:4em">Instructs the tracer to name the trace file
<i>trace_name</i>. The <em>.tr</em> extension should be omitted.</p>
<p style="margin-left:2em"><code>-o <i>output_file</i></code></p>
<p style="margin-left:4em">Causes the tracer to redirect the subject program's output
to <i>output_file</i>. Both <code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code> are redirected
to the specified file.</p>
<p style="margin-left:2em"><code>-&lt;B|E|X|C&gt;</code></p>
<p style="margin-left:4em">Specifies the block types to be included in the generated
trace. All permutations are allowed.</p>

<h5>SequenceFilter</h5>

<p>The tracer <code>SequenceFilter</code> is used to collect a basic
block sequence trace of the execution of a program. A sequence trace lists all of
the basic blocks executed by the program, in order. The program must
be instrumented for sequence tracing to use this tracer; a program instrumented
for coverage tracing cannot be executed. This tracer produces a trace file in
the database directory named &quot;instout.seq&quot; that is readable without
the use of a viewer. <code>SequenceFilter</code> provides the following options
in addition to those provided by <code>Filter</code>:</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em"><code>-pre <i>data</i></code></p>
<p style="margin-left:4em">Causes the tracer to insert <i>data</i> at the start
of the trace file, before any trace data.</p>
<p style="margin-left:2em"><code>-post <i>data</i></code></p>
<p style="margin-left:4em">Causes the tracer to append <i>data</i> at the end
of the trace file, after any trace data.</p>
<p style="margin-left:2em"><code>-relay</code></p>
<p style="margin-left:4em">Instructs the tracer to transmit the trace
(including any <code>-pre</code> or </code>-post</code> data) through a socket
to the port used by a DAG builder to perform dynamic impact analysis.</p>

<p>All other options to this tracer are the same as the options to
<code>Filter</code>. Note that <code>SequenceFilter</code>
writes <em>entry</em> and <em>exit</em> block events to the trace file in a
format specifically designed for use in DAG construction. Finally, be
aware that the trace files generated by this tracer can be extremely
large.</p>

<h5>BranchFilter</h5>

<p>The tracer <code>BranchFilter</code> is used to collect a branch coverage
trace of the execution of a program. As with <code>Filter</code>, it generates
a trace named &quot;instout.tr&quot; in the database directory. Note that the
<code>TraceViewer</code> automatically distinguishes the contents of a trace file.
The usage for <code>BranchFilter</code> is identical to that of <code>Filter</code>
except that branch types are specified instead of block types. Any combination
of I, S, T, C, E, and O is permitted, where the types are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em">I : <code>if</code> branches</p>
<p style="margin-left:2em">S : <code>switch</code> branches</p>
<p style="margin-left:2em">T : <code>throw</code> branches</p>
<p style="margin-left:4em">A <code>throw</code> is only considered as a branch if
it potentially throws more than one class of exception.</p>
<p style="margin-left:2em">C : <code>call</code> branches</p>
<p style="margin-left:4em">A call is considered a branch because execution may
be transferred to some other location in the event that the called method
throws an exception.</p>
<p style="margin-left:2em">E : <code>entry</code> branches.</p>
<p style="margin-left:4em">A method entry is not a branch but is included
to permit some analyses to keep track of the execution of new methods.</p>
<p style="margin-left:2em">O : <code>other</code> branches.</p>
<p style="margin-left:4em">The &quot;other&quot; branch is the branch that
is taken when execution leaves a method for a reason that could not be
statically determined, such as a thrown <code>Error</code>.</p>

<h5>BranchSequenceFilter</h5>

<p>The tracer <code>BranchSequenceFilter</code> is used to collect a branch
sequence trace of the execution of a program. Its usage is identical to that
of <code>SequenceFilter</code> except that branch types are specified instead of
block types.<p>
