<h2 style="text-align:center">Toolkit for Generating Java Mutation Faults</h2>
<a name="mutmain"></a>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>The mutation toolkit is used to generate mutation faults for Java classes.
Mutations are generated from the bytecode of Java classes and applied using
bytecode transformations. The mutation operators used to generate and apply
possible mutants are implemented in a dynamic framework that allows easy addition
of new operators. The two main classes of interest are the
<code>MutationGenerator</code>, which generates tables of possible mutations,
and the <code>Mutator</code>, which applies mutations.</p>

<h3>Running the Mutation Generator</h3>
<a name="mgen"></a>

<p>The mutation generator processes a set of Java classfiles using a set of
enabled mutation operators and generates for each class a table of all the
possible mutations that can be applied to that class. This table lists each
mutation with the operator that generated it and the information necessary to
apply the bytecode transformation. The command to run the mutation generator
is the following:</p>

<p><code>java sofya.mutator.MutationGenerator [-tag <i>tag</i>]
&lt;-c <i>config_file</i>&gt; &lt;classfile|jarfile|listfile&gt;
[classfile|jarfile|listfile ...]</code></p>
<p class="i1"><code>-tag <i>tag</i></code></p>
<p class="i2">Specifies the database tag associated with the
provided program list file, if applicable. Ignored otherwise.</p>
<p class="i1"><code>-c <i>config_file</i></code></p>
<p class="i2">Specifies the configuration file to be used.</p>

<p>If you include the &apos;.class&apos; extension when specifying a single class, it is interpreted
as an absolute path name. If the extension is excluded, the class must be specified using its
fully qualified name, and &#931&#959&#966&#943&#945 will attempt to load it from the classpath.
The mutation generator also accepts jar files and program list files to specify the classes
for which to generate mutations. Program list files are automatically found
in the database, using the tag if one is specified. Any necessary path information
should be provided when passing a jar file as an argument. When a jar file is passed
as an argument on the command line, mutations are generated for every class in
that jar. The preferred way to include classes in a jar file is to include the jar file
in a program list file and supply the program list file as an argument instead, as a
program list file permits you to exclude classes in the jar from processing. Any number
of specific classes, jar files, and program list files can be passed to the mutation generator,
though supplying a single program list file is the expected typical use.</p>

<p>For each class, a file containing the mutation table for that class will be
generated in the working directory from which the mutation generator was run.</p>

<h4>Format of the Mutation Generator Configuration File</h4>
<a name="mgenconf"></a>

<p>The configuration file specifies the enabled mutation operators, and certain global
properties used for loading mutation operators. This file should begin with the keyword
&apos;global&apos; followed by zero or more property/value entries enclosed in braces;
this section declares the global properties. Currently the following global properties
are supported:</p>
<!-- Currently operators are loaded from the classpath
<p style="margin-left:2em"><code>operatorDirectory=&lt;<i>op_dir</i>&gt;</code></p>
<p style="margin-left:4em">Specifies the path to the default directory to search
for operator implementations.</p>-->
<p class="i1"><code>operatorListFile=&lt;<i>list_file</i>&gt;</code></p>
<p class="i2">Specifies the path to the file containing the list of
operators to be enabled by default if <code>defaultEnabled</code> is set
to <code>true</code>.</p>
<p class="i1"><code>defaultEnabled=&lt;true|false&gt;</code></p>
<p class="i2">Specifies whether all operators in the operators list
file should be enabled by default. If <code>false</code>, no operator will be
enabled unless it is explicitly listed in the configuration file. Defaults
to <code>true</code>.</p>

<p>If <code>defaultEnabled</code> is <code>false</code>, the remainder of the file
should list the fully qualified name of the class implementing each operator to
be enabled, followed by a brace-enclosed block. (The braces are present to
support future extensions to the configuration file format).</p>

<h5>Example Mutation Generator Configuration File</h5>
<a name="mgenconfex"></a>

<p>The following is a simple example of a configuration file for the mutation
generator. It specifies that no mutation operators should be enabled by default,
and then enables the argument order change (AOC) and logical connector change
(LCC) operators explicitly.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:2em">
global {
  defaultEnabled=false
}
sofya.mutator.operators.AOC {
}
sofya.mutator.operators.LCC {
}
</pre>

<h3>Running the Mutator</h3>
<a name="mutapp"></a>

<p>The mutator is the tool responsible for actually applying one or more mutations
to the bytecode of a Java classfile to create the mutated class. It uses the
mutation tables produced by the mutation generator in combination with a user
specified selection criteria to apply mutations to a class. To use the mutator,
run the following command:</p>

<p><code>java sofya.mutator.Mutator [-tag <i>tag</i>] [<i>selection_type</i>]
&lt;classfile&gt; [in <i>directory</i>|<i>jarfile</i>]</code></p>

<p>where optional <i>selection_type</i> may be one of the following:</p>
<p class="i1"><code>-all</code></p>
<p class="i2">Selects all mutations. This is the default.</p>
<p class="i1"><code>-ids <i>id_1[:varid]</i>,<i>id_2[:varid]</i>,...,<i>id_n[:varid]</i></code></p>
<p class="i2">Selects mutations by ID and optional variant ID.</p>
<p class="i1"><code>-methods <i>method_list_file</i></code></p>
<p class="i2">Selects mutations that occur in methods specified by method
name and signature. The methods to be selected are listed in <i>method_list_file</i>,
one per line, where each method entry is in source code declaration format with
underscores substituted for spaces, and the fully qualified implementing class name is
prepended (e.g. <code>java.util.Map_public_boolean_containsKey(Object_key)</code>).</p>
<p class="i1"><code>-ops <i>op_1</i>,<i>op_2</i>,...,<i>op_n</i></code></p>
<p class="i2">Selects mutations by operator.</p>
<p class="i1"><code>-random <i>number</i></code></p>
<p class="i2">Selects <i>number</i> mutations randomly.</p>
<p class="i1"><code>-randOp <i>number</i> <i>op_1</i>,<i>op_2</i>,...,<i>op_n</i></code></p>
<p class="i2">Selects <i>number</i> mutation operators from the given
set of operators, and then selects all mutations generated by the selected operators.</p>
<p class="i1"><code>-randMethod <i>number</i> <i>method_list_file</i></code></p>
<p class="i2">Selects <i>number</i> methods from the list of methods
in <i>method_list_file</i>, and then selects all mutations that occur in those methods.</p>

<p>When specifying a class for mutation, the rules regarding inclusion of the
<em>.class</em> extension are the same as for the Mutation Generator.
However, the mutator exhibits additional behaviors with respect to
the format of the class name. If an absolute path is given, the mutation(s)
will be directly applied to the given classfile, at the classfile's current location.
If the class is loaded from the classpath, the resulting mutated classfile will
be placed in the working directory from which the mutator is run.</p>

<p>The class to be mutated can also be qualified with the
&quot;<code>in <i>directory</i>|<i>jarfile</i></code>&quot; clause. If this
extension is present, the class name should be the fully qualified name of the
class using dot notation (no path or extension). The mutator will then attempt
to load and mutate the class in the given location. This is primarily intended
to facilitate the mutation of classes in jar files.</p>

<p>Regardless of how classes are specified to the mutator, the mutation tables for
each class are loaded automatically from the current working directory. Generally it
is expected that the mutator will be run from the same working directory as the
mutation generator.</p>

<h4>Variants</h4>

<p>Certain mutation operators can generate multiple 'variants' at a particular
mutation point. These variants represent a set of mutually exclusive modifications
that can be made to produce a mutation at that location. An example of such
a mutation operator is arithmetic operator substitution, where a single operator
can be mutated into several alternate operators. When such cases arise,
the mutation generator identifies and records all the possible alternatives in
the mutation table as variants of a single mutation, one of which can be chosen
at the time of mutation generation. A default variant is selected, usually
at random. Variants are assigned numeric identifiers, which can be determined
by using the <code>MutationTableViewer</code>. The two display modes of the
viewer can provide either human-friendly or parser-friendly representations of
the possible variants for selection. To select a variant, the appropriate
numeric identifier can be appended to the mutation ID with a colon, using the
"<code>-ids</code>" selector. For example:</p>
<p class="i1"><code>java sofya.mutator.Mutator -ids 3:2 Target.class</code></p>
<p>The above will select the second variant of the third mutation to be
applied to <code>Target.class</code>. In the absence of a specified variant,
the default variant will be used; the default variant can also be determined
using the viewer.</p>
