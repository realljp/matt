<h2 style="text-align:center">Creating a &#931;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945; Program List File</h2>

<p>A &quot;program list&quot; file specifies a set of related Java classes; commonly
this is the set of classes that logically comprise an entire program under analysis.
These files are required by some &#931;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945; tools to perform
actions and analyses that require access to information about multiple classes at
the same time. They also serve as means for conveniently identifying many classes
on which to operate, even when a tool is capable of working on a single class.</p>

<p>A program list file consists of one or more records, specifying a location and
a bracketed list of Java classes. A location is either a directory or a jar file
containing the classes named in the list. Each class in a list is specified in
fully package-qualified dotted notation, and must appear on a separate line.
If the specified location is a directory, the classes in the list are classes
to be <em>included</em>. If the location is a jar file, the classes listed are to
be <em>excluded</em>.</p>

<p>The following is an example program list file:</p>

<pre>
/home/akinneer/java/subject {
    org.tool.Main
    org.tool.impl.Controller
    org.tool.impl.DefaultAlgorithm
    org.tool.impl.FastAlgorithm
}
home/akinneer/java/subject/support.jar {
    org.util.Misc
}
</pre>

<p>This program list file informs a &#931;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945; tool that it
is to operate on the four classes found in the directory
'/home/akinneer/java/subject', and on all classes in the jar file
'/home/akinneer/java/subject/support.jar' except 'org.util.Misc'.</p>

<p>Classes are found and loaded by resolving the package-qualified name against
the location, in the same manner that classes are resolved against a classpath.
However, the class list is always fully processed in sequential order, so
it is possible to specify multiple classes with the same name in different
packages.</p>

<p>A program list file must have the extension '.prog.lst', and be placed in
the &#931;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945; database directory, which is normally a
directory named '.sofyadb' in your home directory. If a program list file is
to be associated with a database tag, you must create a subdirectory with the
same name as the desired tag in the database directory, and place the program
list file in that subdirectory. In the future, we intend to provide tools to
assist in creating and properly storing program list files.</p>

<p>A program list file should be specified with only the '.prog' portion of
the extension whenever it is passed as an argument to a
&#931;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945; tool. For example, if you have created the
file 'system.prog.lst' in the &#931;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945; database, you
should specify it as 'system.prog' when used as an argument to a tool.</p>
