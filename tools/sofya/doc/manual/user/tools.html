<h3></a>Running the Test History Builder</h3>

<p>The test history builder is used to create a test history from a collection of
trace files. A test history shows which basic blocks were exercised by which
test cases, information that is needed by DejaVu for test selection, among other
uses. The test history builder currently only works on basic block traces, a
limitation we will look to address in the future. To use it, run the command:</p>

<p><code>java sofya.tools.TestHistoryBuilder -&lt;E|X|C|B&gt; [-tag <i>tag</i>]
 &lt;tracedir&gt; &lt;histfile&gt; &lt;classname|listfile&gt;</code><br> 
<p class="i1"><code>-E|X|C|B</code></p>
<p class="i2">Instructs the test history builder to include only
selected block types in the test history. Allows any combination of the listed values,
where E corresponds to virtual <i>entry</i> blocks, X corresponds to
virtual <i>exit</i> blocks, C corresponds to call blocks, and B corresponds to
all other basic blocks.</p>
<p class="i1"><code>-tag <i>tag</i></code></p>
<p class="i2">Gives the database tag associated with the control flow
and map files required by the test history builder. Only necessary if a tag was
specified to the CFG builder when constructing the control flow graphs.
<p class="i1"><code><i>tracedir</i></code></p>
<p class="i2">Gives the location of the directory containing the traces
from which to construct the test history.</p>
<p class="i1"><code><i>histfile</i></code></p>
<p class="i2">Gives the name of the history file to be created.</p>
<p class="i1"><code><i>classname</i>|<i>listfile</i></code></p>
<p class="i2">Gives the name of the class or the program list file
containing the list of classes for which the test history is being constructed.</p>

<p>The test history builder will generate a file with the specified name containing the test
history information computed from the trace files.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you use the '<code>-tag</code>' parameter, the
program list file must also be associated with that tag in the database directory.</p>


<h3><a name="coverage"></a>Collecting coverage information</h3>

<p>&#931;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945; provides a tool for reporting the basic block
coverage achieved by a test suite. The coverage tool uses a test history file
to compute this information, so you must first instrument the program for basic
block coverage tracing, collect trace files, and construct the basic block test
history as described above. <em>Note that because of the dependency on test
histories, &#931;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945; does not currently support reporting
of aggregated branch coverage. Branch coverage can still be derived from
individual branch trace files, however.</em> Then you can run the coverage tool
with the following command:</p>

<p><code>java sofya.tools.Coverage &lt;test_history&gt; [-ALL]</code></p>
<p class="i1"><code>test_history</code></p>
<p class="i2">The name of the test history file from which to compute coverage data.</p>
<p class="i1"><code>ALL</code></p>
<p class="i2">This argument instructs the coverage tool to print an output for every
block, whether it was covered or not. If omitted, only blocks that were not covered
are printed by default.</p>

<p>The previous command will cause the coverage information encoded in the test
history to be printed to the console.</p>


<h3><a name="statistics"></a>Collecting statistical information</h3>

<p>A tool is provided with &#931;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945; that can print a variety
of useful statistics about a Java class file, jar file, or program. The statistics
tool can be run with the following command:</p>

<p><code>java sofya.tools.Statistics [-o &lt;outfile&gt;] &lt;classfile|jarfile|listfile&gt;
  [classfile|jarfile|listfile ...]</code></p>
<p class="i1"><code>-o <i>outfile</i></code></p>
<p class="i2">Specifies a file where the statistical output should be written.</p>
<p class="i1"><code>&lt;classfile|jarfile|listfile&gt;</code></p>
<p class="i2">The name of a Java class, jar file, or program list file specifying
classes on which the statistics tool should report. Any number of classes, jar
files, or list files can be specified, and the statistics tool will report
aggregate information for all of the Java classes.</p>

<p>The simplest way to see the types of statistics reported by this tool is to
run the tool on a class. This can be accomplished by running the tool on itself:</p>

<p><code>java sofya.tools.Statistics sofya.tools.Statistics</code></p>
