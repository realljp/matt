University of Nebraska Open Academic License, Version 1.0

Preamble:

This Preamble is intended to describe, in plain English, the nature,
intent, and scope of this License. However, this Preamble is not a part
of this License. The legal effect of this License is dependent only
upon the terms of the License and not this Preamble.

This license is based upon the principle that the sharing of software
with other research and teaching institutions is vital to higher
education and the development of knowledge and understanding.  Further,
the sharing of the source code for the application is mutually
beneficial.  However, these must be weighed against the protection of
intellectual property.  Therefore, we allow the free use of our
software at other institutions of higher learning but reserve the
rights to sell, modify, and distribute the software.  We further allow
the use of the source in order to improve the application but restrict
the use of the source.
